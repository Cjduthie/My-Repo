# My-Repo
My First ever Git Hub Upload/ Repository.
This App Contains Controllers, Models (Which should allow the site to create a database). The Controllers are based of the models.
This App is written using MVC Net Framework 4.5.2, and will most likely not work on previous versions of .net. However later versions may work
but may have Compatiblity Problems.

This Repository is designed for the purposes of an assignment, and contains no warranties or guarantees that this will be supported after those
requirements are met.

Made and complied using Visual Stdio 2016 Enterprise.
